As the end of the first mini-semester is coming to a close, I thought it'd be a good idea to recap what I've learned and what I'm currently doing.
Right now, I'm working on my final project that involves NBA advanced analytics. I've been working on this for the past several weeks, and I'm super excited to finish it! The data I'm working with is pretty awesome - it's approximately 400,000 rows of NBA shot logs.
